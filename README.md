# Machine Learning Experiments in Google Colab

This repository contains a collection of side projects I built during my undergraduate studies 
to learn and experiment with machine learning concepts using Google Colab.

## Projects
1. **Convolutional Neural Network**  
   A basic CNN built using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.

2. **Mini-GPT Model**  
   A small-scale GPT-like language model for text generation, implemented using PyTorch.

3. **Twitter NLP Analysis**  
   Natural language processing pipeline for sentiment analysis of Twitter data.

## Getting Started
All notebooks run in Google Colab, so no local setup is required.  
Simply open a notebook and click **Open in Colab**.

## Technologies
- Python (3.x)
- TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Notes
These are learning projects and are not production-ready models.
